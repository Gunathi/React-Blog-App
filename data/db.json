      "body": "Since the beginning of time, people have sought to understand their purpose and identity. In essence, they have pondered the questions, “Who am I, and why do I exist?” Looking for purpose in financial success, accruing possessions, relationships, or pleasure will always leave us wanting more.Without Christ, we search over and over again and come up short because He is the only One who can satisfy our greatest needs and deepest desires. Augustine said, “Our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.”Christ came to show us who God is in a way that our minds and hearts could understand. He came to show us by His own experience that He understands us and what we’re going through, and He wants a relationship with us. The Almighty God, El Shaddai, came to show Himself to the world through the physical person of Jesus Christ, never once diminishing who He is as God.",

      "body": "hat happens when our God-sized prayers reveal how truly amazing God is. Elijah prayed audaciously because he had a clear understanding of who God is and what God can really do. Elijah believed God when God says to ask and it will be answered. E. M. Bounds puts it like this, “Our praying needs to be pressed and pursued with an energy that never tires, a persistency which will not be denied, and a courage that never fails.” God wants us to pursue Him. He wants to build strength and perseverance in us and He does that sometimes by not answering our prayers right away. He is growing us and maturing us all the time. When we don’t give up asking, seeking and knocking what we receive is of more worth to us. ",

      "body": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. \nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.",
